### Summary

​	Last week I worked on making a nav, setting up an FAQ page, and I set up `top.php` and `bottom.php` with some generally helpful globals variables. I also laid out a rough draft of the master stylesheet.

​	Trey worked on generating content for all the pages specifically he wrote a page or two about how bitcoins/cryptocurrency work. These pages are aimed a general audience, not necessarily a tech-knowledgable audience.

​	Kyle started working on the newsletter email form so we can accept people's emails and send them emails. He now has the HTML laid out. 

### Goals

​	This week we plan to lay out our homepage with a mission statement and newsletter form.  We also want to generate FAQ content.  By the end of this week the newsletter form will save all names and emails to a CSV file.  I will start laying out the "Apply for a Job" page.

### Problems

​	Kyle had difficulty setting up his code editting environment.  He now has his editor set up so he should be able to code unobstructed next week.
