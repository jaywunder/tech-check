### Summary

​	Last week we made less progress than we did the week before.  I personally made the "We're Hiring" page and added validation.  I ask for the user's full name, email, phone number, radio buttons for gender, and have a dropdown for what position they're applying for. 

​	Kyle messed around with the newsletter form on the homepage a little bit.  Trey wrote content about how whitepages work in cryptocurrency. 

### Goals

​	This week I'm going to save the data I get form the hiring form.  Kyle is going to save and validate the data he gets from the newlsetter form. And Trey is going to write more content.  

### Problems

​	This week Kyle wasn't able to program a lot because he had a lot of problems with his editor.  He had a messed up setup but now he doesn't because  Ihelp him work it out.
