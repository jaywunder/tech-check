<h1>Whitepapers</h1>
<h3>Whitepaper is defined as: &quot;a government or other authoritative report giving information or proposals on an issue&quot;. Cryptocurrency whitepapers are basically the same thing. They are write-ups of both the practical use of a currency and the theoretical applications of that currency. I list different whitepapers below that you can download, each accompanied by my own personal opinion of that currency.</h3>

<p>Bitcoin is the mainstream cryptocurrency. Starting the blockchain conversation, Bitcoin has been growing in popularity and market cap for the last 4 years and has introduced a new method, modern method of making and receiving payments. It is by far the most reliable to use, and in actuality it is pretty hard to use most other currencies without first using bitcoin. Whenever I tried to purchase alternative currencies, such as the ones listed below, I was first required to transfer my FIAT (centralized, government created) currency into Bitcoin, and then use an exchange to transfer Bitcoin into that coin. The main point is that Bitcoin is the first currency to familiarize yourself with if you are interested in Cryptocurrencies.</p>
<p>	There are many Bitcoin wallets offered online but I personally suggest that you use Mycelium. Its been around for a while and is a very reliable piece of software.</p>

<h2>Steem: <a href="SteemWhitePaper.pdf"> Download Whitepaper Here</a> </h2> <img src="steem.png", alt="Steem">
<h2>Steemit: Join Network Here</h2>
<p>Steem is a very interesting currency, but not because of any characteristic the coin itself has. Steem is interesting because it exists hand in hand with the social network Steemit, a cryptocurrency based version of Reddit. Upvotes and downvotes actually give or take small amounts of this currency, and if you go viral you can make hundreds of dollars in Steem which you can then convert to Bitcoin or Cash. Its a very well put together network, despite its recent creation. </p>
<p>	Another interesting aspect of this network is that you can invest your Steem into short term stock. This transfer is a one to one ratio and gives you Steempower. Your Steempower earns you interest and can be withdrawn over a longer period of time. This method gives people a fair incentive to invest in the network. 	</p>
<p>	The only caveat here is that the value of Steem has not been that stable, so its still a better idea to invest in Bitcoin. As for a Steem wallet, all of your transactions take place on the Steem network so that is where you store your coins.</p>
<h2>Dash: <a href="Dash_WhitepaperV1.pdf">Download Whitepaper Here</a></h2> <img src="dash.png", alt="dash">
<p>The Dash currency isn&#39;t notable in many ways besides its widespread adoption. The only reason I investigated it was because it had one of the highest values besides Bitcoin (Dash was worth 10 dollars a coin, Bitcoin was worth 600 dollars a coin). The cool thing about Dash is that it is accepted as payment online in a lot of places like Bitcoin. I actually found a cloud mining service which I was able to pay for with the Dash that I purchased early on in my adoption of the technology. </p>
<p>	Dash software isnt the easiest to use because it doesnt have the best developement at this time, but it definitely works.<br/></p>
