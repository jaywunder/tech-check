      <h1 class="header">How do I take care of my laptop battery?</h1>
      <div class="content">
        <p>
          Laptop batteries last longer when you perform shallow discharges, keep them in cool places, and unplug them once they reach 100%.
          To be honest though, Laptop batteries have a finite life and you can't do much to change that, so dont worry too much.

      <h1 class="header">Should I actually click "eject" on my USB drives?</h1>
      <div class="content">
        <p>
          Yes. USB drives don't always write information to drives immediately, so hitting "eject" makes sure every task is complete before you remove your drive.

      <h1 class="header">Are Macs actually Virus-proof?</h1>
      <div class="content">
        <p>
         While they are not tehcnically virus-proof, Macs are more resistant to viruses. I dont even know if they are resistant or PC's are just extremely non-resistant,
          but either way Macs are safer. That's not to say that you won't get a virus on a Mac, it's still completely possible. Just don't click on anything to shady.

      <h1 class="header">Which Operating System is the best for Gaming?</h1>
      <div class="content">
        <p>
        While Mac does offer some good graphics, the obvious answer is Windows. To run most PC games at full settings you need a custom built PC
          which can only run Windows or Linux, and Linux is not the platform to game on.

      <h1 class="header">Is it Illegal to Torrent Music?</h1>
      <div class="content">
        <p>
        It's a safe bet that if you have to ask, you just shouldn't do it in the first place. It's not completely illegal, but you are violating copyright
          laws by torrenting and can get in trouble with your internet provider if you aren't careful. We don't condone torrenting at all.

      <h1 class="header">What's the best Operating System to develop on?</h1>
      <div class="content">
        <p>
        Mac is usually the best OS to develop on. It allows you to manage packages like a linux computer but has better software support for creating programs.
          While Windows is commonly used in the business world, Apple computers are the system of choice for developers. They're sleek and efficient machines.

      <h1 class="header">Whats the best computer?</h1>
      <div class="content">
        <p>
        While this question is heavily debated and up to opinion, we personally think that Mac computers are the best. They offer the most polished and sleek
          platform with the most reliable history. While the Microsoft Surface Book is an amazing piece of technology, Apple is still at the head of premium copmuters in the tech industry.

      <h1 class="header">What is artificial intelligence?></h1>
      <div class="content">
        <p>
       Google defines it as "the theory and development of computer systems able to perform tasks that normally require human intelligence, such as visual perception, speech recognition, decision-making, and translation between languages."
       This is pretty accurate. You basically run an algorithm that allows the computer to test data and figure out which data is better, effectively learning. It runs
          these processes teach the computer what it needs to know. Its pretty cool stuff.
