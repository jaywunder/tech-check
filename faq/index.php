          Laptop batteries last longer when you perform shallow discharges, keep them in cool places, and unplug them once they reach 100%.
          To be honest though, Laptop batteries have a finite life and you can't do much to change that, so dont worry too much.

      <h1 class="header">Should I actually click "eject" on my USB drives?</h1>
      <div class="content">
        <p>
          Yes. USB drives don't always write information to drives immediately, so hitting "eject" makes sure every task is complete before you remove your drive.
