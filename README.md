#Tech Check
Tech check is a website for our team's final project in CS008 at UVM.  

Tech Check is a place to find quick computer help on topics macOS, Windows, Linux, and Bitcoin.  

Tech Check is made without using a database because we haven't learned about databases yet in CS008.

## How to develop
Upload this repository to a folder on your Silk server if you're a UVM student

### Flow
In this project we're going to use branch git flow. Here's an example of branch git flow to make a `Contact Us` page.

 1. Make a branch off `master` called `contact-us`
 2. Commit all changes to `contact-us`
 3. Make a pull request from `contact-us` to `master`
 4. Jacob will look at your code and approve or reject your pull request

### Commits
When you commit, you should have your commit title, with how long it took you to make the commit in this structure: `Initial Commit 1hour` or `Initial Commit 10minutes`.  It is important you include the string "hour" or "minutes" in the commit name. We'll be using this structure to make sure our timestamps are correct and auto generate our time schedule
